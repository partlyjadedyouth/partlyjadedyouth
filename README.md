💡 __Research Interests__

I want to contribute to creating a more __inclusive society__ where marginalized people can express themselves, communicate freely with others, and learn through technology.

My research interests lie at the intersection of: 
- __Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)__
- __Human-AI Interaction (HAI)__
- __AI-mediated communication__
